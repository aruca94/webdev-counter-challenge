1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?
    Answer: "strict mode" is a way to opt into a restricted variant of the language. It enforces stricter rules and eliminates some silent errors, making your code more robust and secure
An example of this could be that when in stict mode any undeclared variables will throw an error making it easier for debugging and error fixing.

2. What does line 3 mean?  Line 3 is assigning the number 0 to the variable "count".

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?   Lines 5-8, You have the constants that are running a query looking for the first html class that is in the parenthesis and assigning it to the const. Why??? Because the constants will be reassigning the inner text as the user increments the count/ decrements the count/resets the count.

4. If you implemented the functionality of the buttons,
   why do you think I wrote the JS code the way I did?  Javascript reads from top to bottom, so you cant reassign a variable that hasnt been declared yet. so basic/general variables declared at the top. As for the functions/eventlisteners from what I've read it won't error anything but is considered good practice to place functions above eventlisteners.
